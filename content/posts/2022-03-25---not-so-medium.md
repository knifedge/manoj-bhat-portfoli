To write blog was a long running lazy dream. In the midst of building multiple product from scratch, i think it's now time to build a portfolio of my own.

In short career of 6 years, my experience has been vast that i would like to share with the world.

When i started this talking about building this custom blog many friends did ask me why waste time on creating a custom blog & not use medium (Medium is Fantastic). You see, i love building stuff ground up & did it for others, why not do something for myself.

Let's see, i have to prepare content though, i hope i get less lazier this time.
