I’m a Software Developer working in UAE, born in a small district called Udupi in Karnataka and bought up in a town called Harihar, Karnataka, India.

I'm passionate about bringing both the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, beautiful pixels and writing clean accessible, human code matters to me. I sweat the details. John Maeda’s Laws Of Simplicity, I agree that less is more.

Ever annoyed at being boxed in, i’ve spent my short career pursuing cross-discipline endeavours and filling unconventional roles as an Engineer. In the 2012s, I began experimenting with the web as a creative medium, utilising established web technologies in new ways. In 2016 I began my professional journey.

Currently, React, React-Native, Typescript and GraphQL are the Technologies that I am working with ❤️. Meanwhile, My best time is spent with my family 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 & exploring Nature, Art, Learning anything that matters to me.
